Supplement keyword-based indexing and models based on linkage information (like PageRank algorithm), with data mining techniques for web click stream analysis for ranking the web pages. This comprised 3 main areas:

1. Web content mining: Determining content relevance. This involved determining frequency, relative distance(among query words) and location of query words on a given page.

2. Web structure mining:  Determining imporatance of a web page based on linkage information(Page Rank Algorithm). This involved ranking each page based on which web pages point/link to this page; and what does the link-text say about the web page.

3. Web usage mining: Using userâ€™s search pattern, trend to improve search results. This involved learning NN-model through user clicks.
